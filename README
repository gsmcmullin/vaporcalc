VaporCalc is an experiment which will become an Engineering RPN 
calculator application.  It is named after the abacus screen in Space
Quest III.

This file just contains some random notes...

Goals:
 - RPN (Postfix) notation
 - Accept input in Engineering/SPICE notation:
   4700, 4.7e3, 3.7k and 4k7 are all the same number.
 - Display numbers in Engineering notation.
 - Extendable in Python or RPN.
 - Access all functions easily with the keyboard.
 - No user interface clutter that doesn't add value.

It is currently usable, but there is no documentation at all.
It is written entirely in Python and makes use of PyGTK and Ply.
The RPN interpreter may be used separately from the UI and should be kept
this way.  
The RPN interpreter is currently just a token scanner, but should be 
replaced with a parser for future features of complex numbers and
PRN programming.

Todo:
 - Programmable key-binding for user funcitons.
 - Rewrite everything as I decide how I want it to work.
 - Selectable formatter for ENG, SCI, FIX, STD.
 - Selectable angle formatter for DEG, RAD, GRAD.
